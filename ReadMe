SQL Database Project
Tables are saved in data folder.
In Employee SQL table:  1. Modeling folder includes sketch of Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables
                        2. SQL folder includes answer of questions and table schemata.

This project involves developing a structured SQL database to manage and analyze employee and departmental data efficiently. The schema design includes tables such as `Departments`, 
`Dept_Emp`, `Dept_Manager`, `Employees`, `Salaries`, and `Titles`, each serving a specific function in organizing the relationships between employees, departments, and their respective
roles and salaries.

Key highlights of the project include:

1. **Table Design and Relationships:**

2. **Key Concepts:**
   - **Primary Keys (PK):** Ensures that each record within a table is unique.
   - **Foreign Keys (FK):** Establishes relationships between tables, ensuring data integrity by linking records in different tables.
   - **Composite Keys:** Used in `Dept_Emp` and `Dept_Manager` tables to uniquely identify records through a combination of two or more columns.

This project demonstrates the application of SQL best practices in designing a relational database schema to support robust data management in a corporate environment.
